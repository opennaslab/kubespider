English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](./README-CN.md)  
I am a Cloud Computing Engineerü§ì, with a focus on Serverless, FinOps, and Runtime. In my spare time, I developed Kubespider to utilize an idle server in a local area network as a NAS, enabling automatic downloads of TV series, triggering downloads from a local laptop, and adapting to various websites such as YouTube and BiliBili, as well as different types of resources such as TV series, movies, and music.

Having been exposed to Terraform, I was impressed by its versatility and inspired to create Kubespider as a general download orchestration system that is compatible with various resource platforms and download software. Kubespider supports multiple download methods, including request trigger, cycle trigger, and update trigger, making it the most comprehensive and unified solution for resource downloads.

## ‚õµ System architecture
To realize a general download orchestration system, it is necessary to adapt various resource websites and download software, so these two parts are abstracted from the core functions:
![image](./docs/images/kubespider-architecture.png)
* `kubespider-core`: The core module of Kubespider accepts the trigger download request, calls the resource provider for resolution (it will eventually be resolved into a standard mode, such as the user enters the bilibili blogger address, and the corresponding resource provider outputs the mp4 file address download list), and finally calls the download provider to implement Download; this module will also periodically call providers (such as TV series provider) to download additional resources.
* `source-provider`ÔºöThe provider of each resource website accepts input of general resource addresses, and outputs standard resource address URLs, such as the personal homepage of a YouTuber, and outputs all mp4 download addresses of the blogger‚Äôs videos. The configuration file is in `.config/source_provider.yaml`.
* `download-provider`ÔºöThe provider of each download software receives the request task from `kubespider-core`, and calls the corresponding service to realize the download. The configuration file is in `.config/download_provider.yaml`.

## üíΩ Installation
### Premise
1. The operating computer and your server are on the same LAN. (I haven't tried the installation not in the same LAN yet)
2. The server is a Linux system„ÄÇ
3. Docker is installed on the server„ÄÇ

### Default installation(Deploy with Docker)
To adapt to multiple resource platforms, Kubespider provides many adapters. Enable or disable these adapters according to your needs. The configuration file is in the `.config` folder:

#### 1.Download the repository and install
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jwcesign/kubespider.git
cd kubespider
bash hack/install_kubespider.sh
```
Output like:
```sh
root@cesign [09:01:34 PM] [+22.0¬∞C] [~/git/kubespider] [main *]
-> # bash hack/install_kubespider.sh
 _          _                     _     _

[INFO] Deploy successful, check the information:
*******************************************
Kubespider config path: /root/kubespider/.config/
Download file path: /root/kubespider/nas/
Kubespider webhook address: http://<server_ip>:3080
Aria2 server address: http://<server_ip>:6800/jsonrpc, you can use any gui or webui to connect it
Aria2 default secret is:kubespider
*******************************************
```
* This step will install `Kubespide` and `Aria2` resource downloader as the default downloader.
* After installation, **all downloaded files will be stored in `${HOME}/kubespider/nas`**.
* Configuration files are located in `${HOME}/kubespider/.config`.

#### 2.Connect to aria2
For checking the download tasks on your server conveniently, go to the chrome store to download [AriaNg plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aria2-for-chrome/mpkodccbngfoacfalldjimigbofkhgjn).  
Then connect, the plugin configuration is as follows(shown at the end of the script `install_kubespider.sh` execution output):
![img](./docs/images/aria2-for-chrome-config-en.jpg)

Of course, it is not necessary, you can also use the desktop program to connect: [AriaNg](https://github.com/mayswind/AriaNg-Native/releases/)

#### 3.Install Chrome plugin
With Kubespider Chrome plugin, you can get a better experience.  
After step 1 has been done, open chrome, then install Kubespider plugin, and configure it as follows(The server address is `http://<server_ip>:3080`):
![img](./docs/images/kubespider-chrome-ext-install-en.gif)  

If I want to download a movie, I can right click and send the download task to Kubespider([demo website](https://thepiratebay.org/)):
![img](./docs/images/kubespider-chrome-ext-usage-en.png)

Then with aria2 chrome plugin, you can see the download task starts:

#### 4.More (Optional)
* Install Plex, watch videos on multiple platforms, [install now](./docs/zh/user_guide/plex_install_config/README.md).
* Install Jellyfin, watch videos on multiple platforms, [install now](./docs/zh/user_guide/jellyfin_install_config/README.md).
* Install Baidu network disk(only in china), download in the background, [install now](TODO).
